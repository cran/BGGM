# Summary

Gaussian graphical models (GGM) allow for learning conditional
(in)dependence structures that are encoded by partial correlations.
Whereas there are several `R` packages for classical methods (see
Kuismin and Sillanpää 2017, Table 1), there are only two that implement
a Bayesian approach (Leday and Richardson 2018; Mohammadi and Wit 2015).
These are exclusively focused on identifying the graphical structure.
The package **BGGM** not only contains novel Bayesian methods for this
purpose, but it also includes Bayesian methodology for extending
inference beyond identifying non-zero relations.

**BGGM** is built around two approaches for *Bayesian*
inference–estimation and hypothesis testing. This distinction is
arbitrary (see Rouder, Haaf, and Vandekerckhove 2018), but is used to
organize this work. The former focuses on the posterior distribution and
includes extensions to assess predictability (Haslbeck and Waldorp
2018), as well as methodology to compare partial correlations. The
latter includes methods for Bayesian hypothesis testing, in both
exploratory and confirmatory contexts, with the novel matrix-\(F\) prior
distribution (Mulder and Pericchi 2018). This allows for testing the
null hypothesis of conditional independence, as well as inequality and
equality constrained hypotheses. Further, there are several approaches
for comparing GGMs across any number of groups. The package also
includes a suite of options for model checking. Together, **BGGM** is a
comprehensive toolbox for Gaussian graphical modeling in `R`.

## Estimation

There are two possibilities for *estimating* GGMs. The first is an
analytic solution and the second samples from the posterior distribution
(described in Williams 2018). Sampling is recommended because the
samples are required for various functions in **BGGM** (e.g., posterior
predictive checks and prediction).

### Structure Learning

Structure learning refers to determining which partial correlations are
non-zero. This is implemented with:

``` r
# data (p = 5 for demonstrative purposes)
Y <- BGGM::bfi[,1:5]

# fit model
fit <- estimate(Y = Y, 
                analytic = FALSE, 
                iter = 1000)

# select graph
E <- select(fit_analytic, ci_width = 0.95)

# summary
summary(E)

# output

Credible Interval: 95 %

3 1 1 0 1 1
4 0 1 1 0 1
5 0 1 1 1 0
--- 
```

It is customary to plot the estimated structure. The implement ion for
plotting `E` is described below, as the same call is also used for the
hypothesis testing methodology.

The partial correlations are plotted with:

``` r
# summarize the posterior distributions
fit_summary <- summary(fit, cred = 0.95)

# plot summary
fig_1a <- plot(fit_summary) 
```

![A) Partial correlations summarized with posterior means and 95%
credible intervals. The red points denote intervals that excluded zero.
B) Bayesian variance explained summarized with probability densities. C)
Posterior predictive (symmetric) KL-divergence. The red area corresponds
to the critical region and the black point is the observed
value.](joss_paper/figure1.jpeg)

The object `fit_summary` includes the partial correlation that have been
summarized with the posterior mean, standard deviation, and a given
credible interval. The object `fig_1a` is a `ggplot` (Wickham 2016),
which allows for further customization. This is possible with all
`plot()` functions in **BGGM**. An example is provided below.

### Predictability

A central aspect of **BGGM** is to extend inference beyond the
individual partial correlations. Assessing *predictability* provides a
measure of “self-determination” (Haslbeck and Waldorp 2018), for
example, how much variance is explained by the variables included in the
model. To this end, **BGGM** provides several options to assess
predictability . In this example, we compute Bayesian \(R^2\) (Gelman et
al. 2019):

``` r
# bayes r2
r2 <- bayes_R2(fit)

fig_1b <- plot(r2, 
               type = "ridgeline")

# output

    2      0.33    0.02    0.30    0.36
    3      0.38    0.02    0.35    0.41
    4      0.18    0.01    0.15    0.20
    5      0.29    0.02    0.26    0.32
```

`fig_1b` is made with the help of the **ggridges** package (Wilke 2018).

### Comparing GGMs

There is additional methodology that allows for comparing GGMs
(described in Williams et al. 2019). For the estimation based methods,
there are three possibilities, including `ggm_compare_estimate()`,
`assess_predictability()` and `ggm_compare_ppc()` . We encourage user to
explore all of those functions. The following is based on the posterior
predictive distribution. In this example, we use data from a resilience
survey to compare GGMs between males and females (Briganti and Linkowski
2019).

``` r
# data
Ym <- subset(rsa, gender == "M", 
             select = - gender)
Yf <- subset(rsa, gender == "F", 
             select = - gender )

# predictive check
ppc <- ggm_compare_ppc(Ym, Yf)

fig_1c <- plot(ppc)

# summary
summary(ppc)

# output
BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
--- 
Type: GGM Comparison (Global Predictive Check) 
Posterior Samples: 5000 
  Group 1: 278 
  Group 2: 397 
Variables (p): 33 
Edges: 528 
--- 
Call: 
ggm_compare_ppc(Ym, Yf)
--- 
Estimates: 
 
     contrast      KLD p_value
 Y_g1 vs Y_g2 2.512792       0
--- 
note: 
p_value = p(T(Y_rep) > T(Y)|Y)
KLD = (symmetric) Kullback-Leibler divergence
```

Note that this method can be used to compare any number of groups.

## Hypothesis Testing

The following methods were described in Williams and Mulder (2019). Note
that each function has `summary()`, `print()`, and `plot()` functions.
The implementation is similar to the estimation based methods, and thus
not included here.

### Structure Learning

The Bayes factor methods allow for gaining evidence for null effects, as
well as for one-sided hypothesis testing.

``` r
# data
Y <- bfi[,1:5]

# fit model
fit <- explore(Y)

# select graph
E <- select(fit, 
            BF_cut = 3, 
            alternative = "greater")
```

The object `E` includes the selected graphs for which there was evidence
for a positive effect and a null effect. This can be plotted with
`plot(E)`. An example is provided below.

### Confirmatory Hypothesis Testing

GGMs are typically data driven and thus inherently exploratory. Another
key contribution of **BGGM** is extending hypothesis testing beyond
exploratory and to confirmatory in GGMs (Williams and Mulder 2019). The
former is essentially feeding the data to the functions in **BGGM** and
seeing what comes back. In other words, there are no specific,
hypothesized models under consideration. On the other hand, confirmatory
hypothesis testing allows for comparing theoretical models or (actual)
predictions. A researcher may expect, for example, that a set of partial
correlations is larger than another set. This is tested with:

``` r
# define hypothesis
hypothesis <- c("(A1--A2, A1--A3) >  
                 (A1--A4, A1--A5)")

# test inequality contraint
test_order <-  confirm(Y = Y, 
                       hypothesis  = hypothesis,
                       prior_sd = 0.5, iter = 5000,
                       cores = 2)
# output
BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models 
Type: Confirmatory Hypothesis Testing 
--- 
Call:
confirm(Y = Y, hypothesis = hypothesis, prior_sd = 0.5, iter = 5000, 
    cores = 2)
--- 
Hypotheses: 
                                   
 H1 (A1--A2,A1--A3)>(A1--A4,A1--A5)
 Hc                        'not H1'
--- 
Posterior prob: 
            
 p(H1|Y) = 0
 p(Hc|Y) = 1
--- 
Bayes factor matrix: 
   H1  Hc
H1  1 Inf
Hc  0   1
--- 
note: equal hypothesis prior probabilities
```

Note that `A1--A2` denotes the partial correlation between variables A1
and A2. Any number of hypothesis can be tested. They just need to be
separated by a a semi-colon, e.g., `hypothesis = c(A1--A2 > 0; A1--A2
= 0)`, which also demonstrates that it is possible to simultaneously
test both inequality (`>` or `<`) and equality (`=`) restrictions.

### Comparing GGMs

The Bayes factor approach can also be used to compare GGMs (see Williams
et al. 2019).

``` r
# compare
bf_comp <- ggm_compare_bf(Ym, Yf, 
                          prior_sd = 0.20)

# select
sel <- select(bf_comp, 
              BF_cut = 3)

# figure 2
fig_2 <- plot(sel)
```

![A) Heatmap depiticing partial correlation differences in favor of a
difference. B) Heatmap depicting partial correlation differences in
favor of the null hypothesis (no difference)](joss_paper/figure2.jpeg)

The results are provided in Figure 2. Note that confirmatory hypothesis
testing is also possible. This uses the same arguments as those provided
above.

## Plotting GGMs

Plotting both the estimate and hypothesis testing graphs uses the same
arguments. The following is an example of plotting a graph estimated
with `explore`.

``` r
# resilience scale
Y <- subset(rsa, select = - gender)

# fit model 
fit <- explore(Y)

# select graph
E <- select(fit, 
            BF_cut = 3, 
            alternative = "greater")

# plot graph
fig_3 <- plot(E, layout = "mds", 
              node_labels_color = "black",
              node_groups = BGGM:::rsa_labels, 
              txt_size = 4, node_outer_size = 8, 
              node_inner_size = 6, 
              edge_multiplier = 5, 
              alpha = 0.3)$plt + 
  # remove legend name and set palette
  scale_color_brewer(name = NULL, 
                     palette = "Set1")  +
  # add title
  ggtitle("Conditional Dependence Structure") +
  # make title larger and add box around legend
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        legend.background = element_rect(color = "black"))
```

## Model Checking

The methods in **BGGM** use custom samplers to estimate the partial
correlations. There are several functions to monitor convergence.
Additionally, there are a variety of methods to check the adequacy of
the fitted model.

### Regression Diagnostics

GGMs have a direct correspondence to multiple regression (Stephens 1998;
Kwan 2014). Hence regression diagnostics can be used to evaluate the
fitted model.

``` r
# data
Y <- bfi[,1:5]

# fit model
fit <- estimate(Y)

# plot
fig_4a <- diagnostics(fit, iter = 100)
```

The object `fig_4a` contains one plot for each variable in model (in
this case five). One of those plots is included in Figure 4 (panel A).

### Posterior Predictive Checks

In **BGGM**, posterior predictive checks are carried out with the `R`
package **bayesplot** (Gabry et al. 2019). Some internal code was
borrowed from **brms** to achieve consistent between packages .

``` r
fig_4b <- pp_check(fit, 
                   type = "stat", 
                   stat = "sd")
```

The object `fig_4b` also contains one plot for each variable in model.
One of those plots is included in Figure 4 (panel B). Note that this
implementation is based on the internals of the `pp_check()` function
from **brms** (Bürkner 2018), but adapted for GGMs. This ensures that
there is consistency between packages using **bayesplot**.

### MCMC Convergence

**BGGM** uses Gibbs samplers to estimate GGMs. The models are not
terribly difficult to estimate, so convergence should typically not be
an issue. To verify convergence, however, **BGGM** provide both trace
and acf plots. An example of the former is implemented with:

``` r
fig_4c <- convergence(fit, 
                      type = "trace", 
                      param = "1--2")
```

This plot is in Figure 4 (panel C). Note that it is possible to check
the convergence of several parameters (e.g., `param = c(1--2, 1--3)`).

## Discussion

There are several additional functions in **BGGM** not discussed in this
work. For example, there are a variety of options for predictability
(e.g., mean squared error), plotting capabilities for `confirm()`, among
others. We encourage users to explore the package documentation. We are
committed to further developing **BGGM**. In the next version, all of
the methods will accommodate ordinal, binary, and mixed data. Currently,
there is one **shiny** application freely available online that
implements the `confirm()` method
[(link)](https://donald-williams.shinyapps.io/confirm/) (Chang et al.
2019). In the near future, all of the methods in **BGGM** will be
implemented in a **shinydashboard** (Chang and Borges Ribeiro 2018).
